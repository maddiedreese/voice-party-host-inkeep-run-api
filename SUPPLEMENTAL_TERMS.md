# Inkeep SDK – Elastic License 2.0 with Supplemental Terms

The Inkeep [SDK] (the "Software") is licensed under the Elastic License 2.0 ("ELv2"), available at [https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license](https://www.elastic.co/licensing/elastic-license), subject to the supplemental terms below. By using the Software, you, your company, and your licensees agree to both ELv2 and these Supplemental Terms – for purposes of these Supplemental Terms, references to "you" have the same meaning as in ELv2 and include your company and contractors acting on your behalf. In the event of conflict, these Supplemental Terms control.

Any copy or redistribution of the Software must include both the ELv2 license reference and these Supplemental Terms.

## 1. Restrictions

### 1.1
You may not use the Software, directly or indirectly, to offer, enable, operate, or provide any Agent Builder.

### 1.2
You may not repackage, rebrand, or otherwise expose the Software's agent-creation or orchestration functionality for third-party use, including in specialized or verticalized offerings that present substantially similar functionality to the Software.

### 1.3
For clarity, the foregoing restrictions do not prohibit your use of the Software as Embedded Assistants or Professional Services, provided neither allow third parties to create, configure, train, orchestrate, deploy, or manage their own agents or agent workflows.

## 2. Definitions

### 2.1 Inkeep
**"Inkeep"** means Inkeep, Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal offices at 169 Madison Ave, Ste 2544, New York, NY, 10016, the licensor (as defined in ELv2) of the Software.

### 2.2 Agent Builder
**"Agent Builder"** means any hosted or on-premise product, platform, UI or API that allows third parties (e.g., customers, developers, or community users other than your personnel) to create, configure, compose, train, orchestrate, deploy, or manage their own Agents using the Software, or that otherwise exposes a substantial set of the Agent-creation and orchestration functionality of the Software.

### 2.3 Agents
**"Agents"** means autonomous, semi-autonomous, or automated systems — including assistants, copilots, workflows, orchestrations, or other systems powered by or incorporating artificial intelligence, machine learning, large language models, or related technologies.

### 2.4 Embedded Assistant
**"Embedded Assistant"** means embedding the Software in your own products or services to power a specific assistant/copilot/agent experience for you or your end users (e.g., a support bot in your app or an internal helpdesk agent), where end users do not receive access to any substantial set of the Software's agent-creation or orchestration features.

### 2.5 Professional Services
**"Professional Services"** means using the Software to deliver a bespoke solution to a single client where only your personnel operate the Software, the client receives access solely to the resulting assistant within the client's environment and not to the agent-creation/orchestration features of the Software, and no multi-tenant or self-service builder is provided.
