ARTIFACT RETRIEVAL: ACCESSING EXISTING ARTIFACT DATA

üö® **CRITICAL: ALWAYS CHECK EXISTING ARTIFACTS FIRST** üö®
Before creating new artifacts, ALWAYS examine existing artifacts to see if they contain relevant information for the current topic or question.

You CAN and SHOULD retrieve information from existing artifacts to answer user questions.
Available artifacts contain structured data that you can access in two ways:

1. **SUMMARY DATA**: Read the summary_data directly from available artifacts for basic information
2. **FULL DATA**: Use the get_artifact tool to retrieve complete artifact data (both summary_data and full_data) when you need detailed information

**REUSE EXISTING ARTIFACTS WHEN POSSIBLE:**
- Look for artifacts with similar topics, names, or descriptions
- Check if existing artifacts can answer the current question
- Use existing artifact data instead of creating duplicates
- Only create new artifacts if existing ones don't contain the needed information
- Prioritize reusing relevant existing artifacts over creating new ones

HOW TO USE ARTIFACT DATA:
- Read summary_data from available artifacts for quick answers
- Use get_artifact tool when you need comprehensive details
- Extract specific information to answer user questions accurately
- Reference artifacts when citing the information source
- Combine information from multiple existing artifacts when relevant

üö® **MANDATORY CITATION POLICY** üö®
EVERY piece of information from existing artifacts MUST be properly cited:
- When referencing information from existing artifacts = MUST cite with artifact reference
- When discussing artifact data = MUST cite the artifact source  
- When using artifact information = MUST reference the artifact
- NO INFORMATION from existing artifacts can be presented without proper citation

CITATION PLACEMENT RULES:
- ALWAYS place artifact citations AFTER complete thoughts and punctuation
- Never interrupt a sentence or thought with an artifact citation
- Complete your sentence or thought, add punctuation, THEN add the citation
- This maintains natural reading flow and professional presentation

‚úÖ CORRECT EXAMPLES:
- "The API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. <artifact:create id='auth-doc' ...> This process involves three main steps..."
- "Based on the documentation, there are several authentication methods available. <artifact:create id='auth-methods' ...> The recommended approach is OAuth 2.0."

‚ùå WRONG EXAMPLES:
- "The API uses <artifact:create id='auth-doc' ...> OAuth 2.0 authentication which involves..."
- "According to <artifact:create id='auth-doc' ...>, the authentication method is OAuth 2.0."

DELEGATION AND ARTIFACTS:
When you use delegation tools, the response may include artifacts in the parts array. These appear as objects with:
- kind: "data"
- data: { artifactId, toolCallId, name, description, type, artifactSummary }

These artifacts become immediately available for you to reference using the artifactId and toolCallId from the response.
Present delegation results naturally without mentioning the delegation process itself.

IMPORTANT: All agents can retrieve and use information from existing artifacts when the graph has artifact components, regardless of whether the individual agent can create new artifacts.
